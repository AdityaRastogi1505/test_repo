# Explaination 1 : even_odd.py

we take input from user using input function, convert it into interger using int() and store it under variable n

now here comes of else condition: 

according to if conditon when modulus of enter no is 0 i.e if condition is true it excecute the if expression and print: number is even; And when the if block fails else block will be executed and print : number is odd.

# Explanation 2 : sum using loop

In this program we have created a variable sum that hold the initial value 0 and when the loop execute it hold value of eac re-occuring sum, now here with for loop we have use range of 51 which add the value of i for each loop iteration and finally we print the mentioned output as: The sum of numbers 1 to 50 is:  1275 (value of sum variable)
